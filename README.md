## Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Streamlit** (for Web Interface)  
- **Scikit-learn**, **XGBoost** (for ML Models)  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** (for Data Processing)  
- **Matplotlib**, **Plotly** (for Data Visualization)

## Features

- **Historical Data Preprocessing**: Clean and structure raw stock data for modeling.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Forecast stock prices using:
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor
- **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - Time-series plotting of real vs predicted prices
  - Model performance comparisons
- **Dynamic Inputs**:
  - Select different price input (Open, High, Low, Close)

## Machine Learning Workflow

1. **Data Loading**: Import historical stock prices from CSV.
2. **Feature Selection**: Selecting required features from the dataset.
3. **Train Test Split**: Splitting training and testing set for time series split.
4. **Model Training**: Fit and train Random Forest and XGBoost models on training data.
5. **Prediction & Evaluation**: Predict future prices and compare model metrics.
6. **Visualization**: Plot results for easy interpretation.
6. **Making live predictions**: Input current price (Open, High, Low, Close) to make predictions for the next day price for High candle.
